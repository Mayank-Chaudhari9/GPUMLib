# GPUMLib

Been itching to start applying machine learning to GPGPUs for a long time.
I do not have the original sources to compare for accuracy as i pulled this from somewhere on the Internet.

# Goals

My goal is to make sure its correct (from an algorithm point of view), benchmark it and finally 
embellish it with CUDA 7.0 / OpenCL 2.1 (the latter is pending support from available hardware which is not slated to provide 
support till much later in 2015).

Basically, its going to look like a scratch pad more than anything else. Feel free to clone or submit PRs if you like.
